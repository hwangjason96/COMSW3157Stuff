Notes for 02/06/26

C vs Java (C gives you more power)
C is procedural, not objected-oriented (No methods nor fields)
Code is built around functions (Function-oriented programming)
Struct (Grouping of variables)

Memory management in C is totally up to you.
C: malloc and free (malloc = manual allocation of memory, free = free memory)

Syntax:

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){

        return 0; //Every statement ends with a ;
}

Wrong Syntax:
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
        return 0;
        printf("Hello, World!\n"); //a simple print statement
} 
NOPE! There is no output

primitive data types

char, short, int, float, long, long long, double, float

char <= short <= int <= long <= long long

8 bits in a byte
char: 1 byte, 
short: 2 bytes, 
int: 4 bytes, 
float: 4 bytes, 
long: 8 bytes, 
long long: 8 bytes, 
double: 8 bytes.

signed vs unsigned variables:
int x; [-2^31,2^(31)-1]

 1011
+1011
-----
10110 -> overflow

2's comp:
1. start with +5 in 8 bits: 0000101
2. flip all the bits: 1111010
3. add 1: 1111011 this is the 2's comp of 5, or -5.
Leftmost bit being 1 means it is a negative number

-1? as a signed char is 11111111

Inverse:
if you see a number: 11101111
1. flip, add 1
-00010001 = (-17)_10

== or != (equality operators)
<, >, <=, >= relational operators: 1 true or 0 false

&& AND
|| OR
! NOT
THESE ARE SHORT CIRCUIT OPERATORS

& bitwise AND
| bitwise OR
~ bitwise NOT
& bitwise XOR

we can OR something to turn it on.
we can AND something to turn it off.

we can XOR to flip all of the bits

<< bitwise left shift (multiplication by 2)
>> bitwise right shift (int divison by 2)

examples of numbers
hexadecimal : 0x4b (0x is important)
unsigned int: __u (u as a postfix)
long: __l (l as a postfix)
unsigned long (ul as a postfix)
double: 314159e-5L (e-_L is there for the amount of decimals)
flaot: __f (f as a postfix)
char: '_' ('' as a pre and post fix)

Part1 asks you to compute the gcd
argc, argv[i]
argc: how many arguments there are
argv[i]: lets you access each one by index

we don't really like atoi, but allowed for the latest hw.

printf!

scanf: 
scanf("%d", &some_int);

putc allows you to write 1 character to a file or an output stream.

THe crazy way of swapping two numbers by doing 3 bitwise exclusive ors.
